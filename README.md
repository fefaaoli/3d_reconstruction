# 3d_reconstruction

These graphs together track an object's 3D trajectory using two camera perspectives.

- **3D Plot**: Shows the object’s path, speed, and direction in 3D space.
- **2D Plots**: Show the object’s pixel coordinates in each camera, helping calculate depth.

**Purpose**: The combined data from both cameras reconstructs the object’s full 3D trajectory and movement details.
