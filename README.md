# Tasks Overview

## Task 2: 3D Trajectory Reconstruction Project
This task focuses on reconstructing the 3D trajectory of a kicked ball using videos captured by two cameras. The process involves extracting 2D coordinates of the ball and calibration points from the videos and calculating the 3D trajectory through Direct Linear Transformation (DLT).

## Task 3: 3D Trajectory Analysis Project
This task aims to analyze and visualize the 3D trajectory of a ball using data from two cameras (Camera 1 and Camera 2). It utilizes the `matplotlib` library to estimate the ball's position in 3D space based on the 2D coordinates and generate detailed 3D plots.

### Objectives:
1. Estimate the 3D trajectory of the ball from the 2D coordinates provided by the cameras.
2. Create 3D plots to visualize the ball's trajectory.
3. Incorporate oriented triangles into the plot to depict the ball's orientation at each point along the trajectory.
